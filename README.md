# PACT
### One year project at Télécom Paris
With 5 other students, we worked on a social network for sharing events such as sports matches, concerts, carpooling or dinners.

With Eugène Berta and our instructor Jean-Louis Dessalles, we worked on the AI part and intelligent event recommendation.

With Julien Toucheboeuf and our instructor Jean-Claude Dufourd, we worked on the client server part.
